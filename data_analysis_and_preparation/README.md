# Data Analysis & Preparation
1. Description of the dataset, its source, and motivation for the project
2. Visualize/Plot the distribution of each input features and discuss the range of the values (min, max, mean, median, etc.)
    - For example, plot histograms showing distribution of each input features
3. Study the distribution of the output labels
    - In case of classification, check if the data is imbalanced
    - In case of regression, check if the values are uniformly distributed or not
4. Data normalization
