# Data Analysis & Preparation
1. Split the data into training, and validation sets
2. Compare the results of the neural network with a linear regression or logistic regression model
    - Start with a basic model and then grow your model into a multi-layered model
    - Discuss how neural network models will be selected
    - Document your performance comparison
3. Study performance difference when linear activation is used instead of sigmoid (and vice versa)
    - How does your performance change when linear activations are used instead of sigmoid, in the last neuron and all other neurons?
4. Plot your learning curves and include them in your report
5. Discuss what architecture (how big) you need to overfit the data
6. Discuss what architecture (how big) you do need to overfit when you have output as additional input feature
7. Evaluate your predictions (using Precision, Recall, MAE, MSE, etc.)
8. [OPTIONAL] Code a function that represents your model
    - After your model is trained, read all the weights, and build your own function/method that serves as the model
    - Verify that predictions you obtain are same as the one you obtained using your trained model
